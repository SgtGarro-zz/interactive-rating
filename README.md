## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind (CSS Framework)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Compared to other frameworks such as BootStrap, Tailwind is a framework that allows us to customize our styles that we want to use for our project, apart from the fact that it is based on the basics of utility first. 
That is, stop writing classes that we will possibly use only once like
```html
<div class="shopping-cart"></div>
<div class="article-news-container"></div>
```
And start using the classes for more general purposes, like
```html
<div class="py-5"></div> <!-- add vertical padding -->
<div class="mx-6"></div> <!-- add horizontal margin -->
```

### Continued development
To tell the truth, I still don't have much experience regarding CSS frameworks, CSS animations and DOM handling in depth, so it might not be the most tunable code but that's what these challenges are about, improving.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) - This helped me a lot to get started and use all the tools that provides Tailwind.
